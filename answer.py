    Kinshasa, formerly LÃ©opoldville (Dutch: Leopoldstad), is the capital and the largest city of the 
    Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city is situated alongside the Congo River.
    
    Once a site of fishing and trading villages, Kinshasa is now a megacity with an estimated 
    population of more than 11 million. It faces Brazzaville, the capital of the neighbouring 
    Republic of the Congo, which can be seen in the distance across the wide Congo River, making 
    them the world's second-closest pair of capital cities after Rome and Vatican City. The city 
    of Kinshasa is also one of the DRC's 26 provinces. Because the administrative boundaries of 
    the city-province cover a vast area, over 90 percent of the city-province's land is rural in 
    nature, and the urban area occupies a small but expanding section on the western side.
    
    Kinshasa is Africa's third-largest urban area after Cairo and Lagos. It is also the world's 
    largest Francophone urban area (surpassing Paris in population), with French being the 
    language of government, schools, newspapers, public services, and high-end commerce in the 
    city, while Lingala is used as a lingua franca in the street. Kinshasa hosted the 14th 
    Francophonie Summit in October 2012.
