# Learning ü§ó Transformers

Experiments inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jmcimula/status/1213623492807135234/photo/1).

## QA pipeline

### Notes

1. Running `pipeline(...)` for the first time may take time, because
   it automatically downloads from S3 the required pretrained models.
2. They are cached in `.cache/torch/transformers` (even if TensorFlow is
   used).
3. I found no way to download them explicitly like it is possible for NLTK
   or spaCy (discussed [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/2323)
   and [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/2157)), but you can
   view the contents of the [models.huggingface.co](https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/)
   bucket.
4. Sometimes I had to start the pipeline multiple times before it finally
   managed to download all the files - either the connection timed out and
   the downloaded files were corrupted
   (`Unable to open file (truncated file: eof = 244962661, sblock->base_addr = 0, stored_eof = 265582824)`).
   - UPDATE: It must have been an issue with my home network or my ISP.
             Switching to mobile hotspot solved the problem immediately.
